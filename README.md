# Welcome to Glue!

__Glue__ is a __Haxe__ framework for making and prototyping __2D games__.
It's still an alpha version but stay tuned! A lot of features will be uploaded soon.

## Demo

There's a minimal sample project under `demo/` that exercises the library by spawning a player catching falling items.

```bash
cd demo
haxelib install openfl
haxelib install actuate
haxelib run lime test html5
```

The demo reuses the sources in `src/`, so any local changes to the framework are reflected immediately.
